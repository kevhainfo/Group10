499,SA807: Object detection and embedded vision,"US, MA, Cambridge",SA,,"<h3>MERL's internship program gives students excellent opportunities to work in an industrial research lab environment side-by-side with world-class researchers.</h3>
<p>The internship program at MERL emphasizes close collaboration with a particular researcher or members of a small team. Primary areas of work include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mechatronics and control</li>
<li>Algorithms and optimization</li>
<li>Signal Processing</li>
<li>Digital &amp; optical communications</li>
<li>Imaging, computer vision and graphics</li>
<li>Video processing</li>
<li>Data Analysis, modeling and planning systems</li>
<li>Information security</li>
<li>Speech and audio processing</li>
<li>Machine learning</li>
</ol><p>A primary intent of the program is to provide interns with experience that could help them enhance and accelerate their professional career, while also contributing to new or ongoing initiatives at MERL. Interns will be exposed to relevant industrial problems ranging from speculative and exploratory research to more practical engineering tasks. We hope that all interns have a chance to become familiar with our organization and the open research culture at MERL, produce publishable work, and develop an appreciation for how breakthrough research makes an impact on future products.</p>
<p>MERL considers graduate students from all over the world. As many of our projects benefit from specialized knowledge in a given field, graduate students pursuing a Ph.D. typically fill the majority of internship openings.</p>
<p>The duration of a typical internship varies from 3 months to 1 year, with the majority of interns being employed during the summer months. As the summer is a very busy time, we encourage applications for non-summer internships and also prefer early applications for summer internships. Hiring decisions for the summer are typically made around February/March to allow enough time for any necessary paperwork (such as visa applications or other work eligibility forms) to be completed.</p>
<p>Boston is a fantastic city with one of the largest student populations of any city in the US. There are many social and leisure activities to get involved in, and no shortage of things to do during your stay. With close proximity to major universities such as MIT and Harvard, there are also many chances to attend seminars and lectures by well-known experts in various fields. During the summer, MERL also organizes a number of social activities for all interns to participate. Some past activities included BBQ outings, whale watching, Wii tournaments, and movie nights.</p>
<p>ÃÂ Benefits of interning at MERL:</p>
<ol>
<li>Experience:ÃÂ At MERL, you will work closely with top researchers and participate in a lab-wide R&amp;D culture with a unique mix of curiosity-driven research and market-oriented prototyping.</li>
<li>Publication:ÃÂ MERL is an open research lab with a strong tradition of publication in high-impact peer-reviewed venues. Internships typically aim at producing publication-worthy results and interns are co-authors on many papers each year.</li>
<li>Compensation:ÃÂ MERL offers competitive hourly rates based on relevant education, skills, and work experience. Interns are also paid for company holidays during their employment.</li>
<li>Perks:ÃÂ MERL provides relocation assistance including travel costs; subsidies for commuting costs; entertainment events for interns to get to know Boston and each other.</li>
<li>Networking:ÃÂ Interns are encouraged to network with MERL's research staff, fellow interns, and faculty at local universities. Weekly socials and seminars provide many opportunities.</li>
<li>Opportunity:ÃÂ Many MERL interns have gone on to distinguished careers at MERL. MERL research hosts have often provided letters of reference supporting their ex-interns' candidacies for jobs, fellowships, and tenure.</li>
</ol>","<p>MERL is looking for a self-motivated intern to work on the area of object detection and embedded vision systems. The ideal candidate should have a solid understanding of the visual object detection problem and hands-on experience on embedded systems and GPU. Proficiency in C/C++ programming is necessary. Experience in deep learning algorithm is a plus. The candidate will collaborate with MERL researchers in developing systems, conducting experiments, and preparing manuscripts for publication</p>

<p>While we sell graduation caps and gowns, our culture is anything but a clothing manufacturer .ÃÂ  The office is located in a reclaimed paint factory, the first test in the interview is to see if a candidate can navigate the building with all the secret passages and stairwells that only go to certain floors. We tend to call it our own little Hogwarts, minus the moving stairs and paintings that help you find your way. The company itself is owned by a parent company (The Gordon Group) that sits in the same office and owns a number of growing companies, including Avanti Systems, and is opening a startup incubator for gen z this summer. So you will be working with some of the best minds in digital marketing, web development, customer service, and entrepreneurial development in an open environment that allows for collisions and collaboration to thrive.</p>
<p>We hire and fire based on our culture so we advise you do some research on our company, read some of the articles we have published, and let us know why you would be a good fit.</p>
<p>Some of the fun things we do includ:</p>
<p>ÃÂ· Book club</p>
<p>ÃÂ· Training Events for both personal and professional development are held regularly</p>
<p>ÃÂ· Monthly activites that vary (Past events have included deep sea fishing, paintball, kite flying, the electric run)</p>

<p>Founded in 1929 by Earl Bertrand Bradley, the company began selling products for Knape and Vogt Co. of Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p>
<p>With the opening of the Los Angeles branch in 1929, the company became a wholesale distributor specializing in store fixture and specialty hardware such as drawer slides, hinges, brackets and standards. In 1943 branch offices were opened in San Francisco followed by Seattle in 1956.</p>
<p>The companyÃ¢ÂÂs market position and business began to grow during the late 1950Ã¢ÂÂ²s and 1960Ã¢ÂÂ²s after adding WilsonartÃ¢ÂÂs high-pressure laminate line to its product mix.</p>
<p>During the 1970Ã¢ÂÂ²s under the leadership of E.B. BradleyÃ¢ÂÂs son Robert E. Bradley, Sr., two new branches were opened; San Diego in 1972 and Portland in 1976. Significant product additions were the Blum line of European hinges and drawer slides and Accuride precision ball bearing drawer slides. A greater emphasis as a supplier to the Cabinet and Furniture industries was taking hold.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Anaheim branch in 1995, the company has been consistently growing.<br>In 1998 the company entered the cold press lamination business by opening 3 locations of its West Coast Laminating subsidiary in the Los Angeles, San Francisco and Pacific Northwest marketplaces.</p>

712,Fidelity,,,,,"<p>The key to this position is that Steve wants to see how people think. ÃÂ He doesn't want to see extensive models or get a lot of background on the stock. ÃÂ He wants the person to dive into the analysis of the stock and really show why they believe the stock can move. ÃÂ So for example he would rather see that you've done your research on Apple and believe that X Million people will buy their smartwatch because of reasons X, Y, Z and support those reasons. Then establish what you think the price is going to be for the product and then that should lead to T amount of profit which should boost the stock by some amount. ÃÂ I don't even think the person needs to give a predicted stock price just what the upside is in terms of profit. ÃÂ If they can calculate a stock price that's obviously beneficial.</p>

155,Online Systems Manager (Virtual/Remote),,,,,"<h3>A Unique Job With a Great Company</h3>
<p>Do you want an exciting job you love, working with other superstars? Are you excited by making a real difference with our team? Join us as our Online Systems Manager!<br><br>WeÃ¢ÂÂre a unique and innovative marketing technology &amp; services companyÃ¢ÂÂ¦ And weÃ¢ÂÂre growing!</p>
<p>Our Online Systems Manager position is a key role in our company, because youÃ¢ÂÂll be in charge of the online tools we use to service our clients, as well as promote our own services.</p>
<h3>What Do We Do?</h3>
<p>Our company has offers marketing technology and services to attorneys. We'veÃÂ created a proprietary combination of technology, marketing creative, and business processes that allow lawyers to plug in to our systems very quickly, and stop worrying where their next client will come from.ÃÂ Our customers are great people who are a pleasure to work with Ã¢ÂÂ and we become real partners to their business, helping them meet their goals by providing something they want and need.</p>
<h3>
<br>What Will You Do?</h3>
<p>As an Online Systems Manager, you will do two things:</p>
<p>1) Work directly with our US-Based Client Services Managers to configure and maintain systems to deliver marketing services to our clients. Our Client Services Managers work directly with our attorney clients, and you'll support them in that effort.</p>
<p>2) Assist with configuring marketing systems for our own marketing campaigns - the ones which bring customers to us. You'll help manage our markting automation, email campaigns, website, blog, webinars, etc.</p>
<p>While this is <i>not</i> a programming job, <b>you should be comfortable with the basic configuration of online tools</b>. If you are comfortable deploying a Wordpress site, including adding themes and plugins, and doing basic HTML/CSS then you'll do fine. We can teach you all the other systems. If you're not completely comfortable with this level of technical configuration, then this probably isn't a fit.</p>
<p>If you are experienced with configuring marketing automation systems (such as Infusionsoft, Office Autopilot/Ontraport, etc) then you are very qualified.</p>
<h3>Working With Us</h3>
<p>Our offices are in San Francisco, CA, but you may work remotely anywhere in the world so long as your work day overlaps with our work day (9am - 5pm Pacific) by at least two hours every work day.ÃÂ </p>
<p>This is a full time position. Applicants are expected to not have any other employment, freelance or otherwise.</p>
<h3>Our Hiring Process</h3>
<p>Our hiring process is different. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs because weÃ¢ÂÂre serious about a long-term partnership with you, and weÃ¢ÂÂre willing to put in the time up front to ensure itÃ¢ÂÂs a fit for both of us. That also means youÃ¢ÂÂll need to put in extra time as well, but as a result youÃ¢ÂÂll know whether this is the place for you.</p>
<p>Our process is designed to find superstars who want to work with other superstars. People interested in a fundamentally different organization where everyone is motivated for excellence, and everyone gets to work on things which make the most of their abilities.</p>
<p>But, you canÃ¢ÂÂt tell whoÃ¢ÂÂs a superstar from a resume, and it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt come across in a short interview either.</p>
<p><i>So our process is designed to let you get to know us, and us to get to know you, before we move on to meeting in person or via video call. We typically screen over 130 applicants before we hire someone because weÃ¢ÂÂre looking for the best candidate Ã¢ÂÂ and one whoÃ¢ÂÂs also motivated to work with top-performing colleagues.</i></p>
<p>As you read this process, do not get intimidated. The first steps are intended to give you a picture of who we are and what we do, so you can get a feel for what itÃ¢ÂÂs like working with us. As the process goes along further, it gets more personal. If itÃ¢ÂÂs a fit then rest assured youÃ¢ÂÂll have more than enough time to get all the information you need and speak personally with us to make a good decision for you.</p>
<p><b>Step 1.</b> First, youÃ¢ÂÂll fill in an application, with a little information about you. As a part of this application, youÃ¢ÂÂll be asked to answer a few questions, and also shoot us a quick video introducing yourself (60-90 seconds) so we can get a better idea of who you are. We donÃ¢ÂÂt care about the quality of the video, we just want to see how you communicate since youÃ¢ÂÂll be working remotely and communication is very important for success in this role.</p>
<p><b>Step 2.</b> If your application looks like a fit, weÃ¢ÂÂll send you a series of videos about our company and its products. Watch those videos to get a sense for the problems weÃ¢ÂÂre solving, and why lawyers want our solution. Then we'll ask you how your experience fits with the products you learned about in the videos.</p>
<p><b>Step 3.</b> Our recruiter will be in touch to request other information, do a phone/skype screening call, and discuss next steps.</p>
<p>You should <b>not</b> contact the company outside this process.</p>","<ul>
<li>You have excellent written and spoken English skills.</li>
<li>You have a college or advanced degree.</li>
<li>YouÃ¢ÂÂre organized, and like staying organized. If something isnÃ¢ÂÂt organized, you look for a way to systematize it.</li>
<li>You are comfortable asking questions when you don't understand something, and if you aren't getting the answers that you need, are comfortable following up until you get the information you need.</li>
<li>You must be detail-oriented, and able to follow our processes to ensure a gold-standard experience for our customers.</li>
<li>You like working on a team, and keeping in touch with the team regularly even though you are not physically in the same office.</li>
<li>You are known for being professional, dependable and punctual.</li>
<li>You are willing to pitch in with other needs as the company grows. This means helping out with 'whatever needs to get done' in order to wow our customers.</li>
<li>You donÃ¢ÂÂt take things personally, or get offended easily, when getting feedback. Rather, you use it as an opportunity to learn and do better. If you are easily offended then this is not a good fit for you.</li>
<li>YouÃ¢ÂÂre comfortable motivating yourself to get things done. Our culture is that we expect everyone to manage themselves (with appropriate guidance and full information). We donÃ¢ÂÂt micro-manage. This means that self motivated people thrive, and people who want to coast wonÃ¢ÂÂt last long.</li>
<li>You expect excellence, both from yourself and from your co-workers.</li>
<li>YouÃ¢ÂÂre curious, like the idea of stretching a little, and love to learn.</li>

Interns will be exposed to relevant industrial problems ranging from speculative and exploratory research to more practical engineering tasks.

As the summer is a very busy time, we encourage applications for non-summer internships and also prefer early applications for summer internships.

492,Apple Sales Associate,"US, CA, San Francisco",,,"<p>Started as a business development and consulting firm, Create More has grown into San FranciscoÃ¢ÂÂs Premier Apple Specialist. After 13 years in business and approaching 11 years at the same SOMA/South Beach location, Create More continues to grow and find ways to work with you to enhance your Macintosh experience. A real store that you can walk in to and browse products, no appointment repair service and a training center are just some of ways we make your decision to work with Create More an easy one.</p>
<p>At Create More, we want to be more than the Apple computer dealer where you buy your new Macintosh, iPads, iPods, peripherals and accessories. We want to be your source for support and information too. When you refer to your friend who knows about computers, we want that to be us!</p>
<p>Our staff is eager to answer your questions and work with you and provide you with the products and solutions you need. Pre and post sale support is equally important to us. ÃÂ We want you to get the right computer and then make sure that it does what you need and you are comfortable using it!</p>
<p>The relaxed boutique environment of our store is just the start of how we want you to enjoy your Mac experience.</p>
<p><b>How do you go from business development to selling Macs? WeÃ¢ÂÂre glad you asked!</b></p>
<p>In 1997, the seeds of Create More were planted. Looking for better ways to grow a business. What are the most effective marketing solutions? How should a business position itself? How to communicate these finding to clients?</p>
<p>These were but a few questions that were the foundation of Create More. Through workshops, research, and partnerships, a solid base was built. Officially formed in 1999, Create More worked with clients to grow their businesses. In the process of learning about our clients, we also learned a lot about ourselves, but weÃ¢ÂÂll get to that shortly</p>
<p>In working with our clients on their businesses, we found certain obstacles. To grow, focus needed to be kept on processes and not infrastructure. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs just a fancy way of saying, you canÃ¢ÂÂt win the race if you can find the keys to start your car.</p>
<p>It became clear to us, that if we could simplify the day to day, our clients could then focus on the task at hand, building and growing their businesses. The more time we spent on simplifying the process of doing business, the more we realized technology was the biggest hurdle. The more we made recommendations on technology, the more we realized we needed to be the source of the technology we recommended and implemented.</p>
<p>It wasnÃ¢ÂÂt long before we realized our true calling. We took a hard look at what we were doing and what was most effective for our clients. Creating, managing, and implementing technology solutions would be far more valuable to our clients.</p>
<p>We still continue to evolve and grow, and we always have our clientsÃ¢ÂÂ best interest in mind. Whether itÃ¢ÂÂs a home user or a company with hundreds of users, we want to make sure the use of their Macs is productive, effective, and as easy as possible.</p>
<p>With all of the web sites and big box stores, weÃ¢ÂÂre happy to be a small, independently owned business with the one main goal in mind Ã¢ÂÂ you and your Mac.</p>","<p>Create More is an Independently owned Apple Specialist store in the Heart of San Francisco.

<p><b>Why work at Offerial</b></p>
<p>A startup company is different than a big company. Startups are teams of excellent people that develop products to solve a need or a pain of thousands or millions of customers with repeatable &amp; scalable business models. Most of the product features a startup team develops will get thrown away very quickly and replaced by newer, better ones, others will be modified, and maybe the entire startup will pivot to an entirely new direction at some point in its life cycle.</p>
<p>Team members in a startup like Offerial must understand that there are no role limitations &amp; no concrete job descriptions as one might expect to find in large(r) companies. Team members may start doing a certain job when they join the team and may end up 6 months later doing something completely different and this is perfectly normal. Actually, we love it when this happens!</p>
<p>We love people who have a short learning curve that have the habit of learning new things (even things that may seem of no importance), people who are open to new ideas as well as lean &amp; agile.</p>
<p>We deeply appreciate people who are able to let go and not get attached on things they worked really hard to achieve, if the new one is better, and in general people constantly excited by change, new challenges and the ""impossible situations"" where for the first few hours/weeks there doesn't be to be a solution to a problem!</p>
<p>We do not judge people's abilities based on university degrees or fancy titles. We only care about each person's satisfaction &amp; ability to deliver and to strive at what we do.</p>","<p>We are seeking a bright and capable Senior Web Developer to work on our core products, for architecting, deploying, and maintaining systems in a live, high-traffic environmentÃ¢ÂÂ.

Not for its own sake but because we make games for big audiences and that means itÃ¢ÂÂs got to work all the time.ÃÂ Because we are in a competitive space and that means we need to be fast and efficient.ÃÂ We are serious about sprint management. ItÃ¢ÂÂs good for our game, and keeps us focused.</p>
<p>We are a creative company tempered by great analytics.ÃÂ Smart analytics can make a good game even better.ÃÂ But we think analytics alone makes soulless products. Why choose just one?</p>","<p>Space Ape is growing fast. ÃÂ A little over 12 months ago we were 15 people and the finance role involved predicting our burn rate and runway and funding needs. ÃÂ Now, 12 months later, we are over 60 people, profitable with over $20m in annual revenue and now need to create a finance function. ÃÂ ÃÂ With $10m in venture funding, customers in 149 countries and forecast annual growth at over 400% you will be joining one of the next big break-out successes of the London tech scene at precisely the right time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As Space ApeÃ¢ÂÂs FIRST full time finance person you will have a clean slate and an opportunity to shape the direction of the company. ÃÂ ÃÂ Internally, youÃ¢ÂÂll need to ensure the day to day finance operations run smoothly but will also help spearhead our entry into new markets and oversee multi-million dollar marketing budgets to ensure that we deploy our significant capital wisely.
