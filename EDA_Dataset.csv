We are looking for people that are quick learners, and are very efficient, to handle the demand. <br><br>We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! <br><br><br>We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. <br><br><br>Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us. We simply call that exclusive lead and set up an appointment with them. We meet the customer in their home and go over what type of mortgage protection the homeowner needs and then write up the policy. We also market and promote fixed indexed annuities that solve most of the baby boomers retirement issues. <br><br><br>We have many full time agents making over 6 and 7 figure incomes! We are primarily looking for those that desire to move into management, though, if you are looking for part time or full time warm sales, please send your resume as well. We have a serious demand all over the 703/202/301 area that consistently outweighs our number of agents. <br><br><br>Typically our employees make 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management. Though, we design a specific plan to make sure you hit whatever compensation YOU seriously desire, and are willing to work for. <br><br>What we are looking for: <br>* A passion to honestly help families. <br>* Positive attitude with a strong desire to become wealthy. <br>* A person who can follow a step by step selling system. <br><br><br>What we are not looking for: <br>*Someone who isn't accountable to their word. <br>*Someone who says they are a great salesman, but doesn't have a penny to their name. <br>*Someone who has had a recent foreclosure or bankruptcy (you can't get licensed in those cases) <br><br>We need you and you need us.

Interns will be exposed to relevant industrial problems ranging from speculative and exploratory research to more practical engineering tasks. We hope that all interns have a chance to become familiar with our organization and the open research culture at MERL, produce publishable work, and develop an appreciation for how breakthrough research makes an impact on future products.</p>

<p>The duration of a typical internship varies from 3 months to 1 year, with the majority of interns being employed during the summer months. As the summer is a very busy time, we encourage applications for non-summer internships and also prefer early applications for summer internships. Hiring decisions for the summer are typically made around February/March to allow enough time for any necessary paperwork (such as visa applications or other work eligibility forms) to be completed.</p>","<h3>

Interns will be exposed to relevant industrial problems ranging from speculative and exploratory research to more practical engineering tasks. We hope that all interns have a chance to become familiar with our organization and the open research culture at MERL, produce publishable work, and develop an appreciation for how breakthrough research makes an impact on future products.</p>
<p>MERL considers graduate students from all over the world. As many of our projects benefit from specialized knowledge in a given field, graduate students pursuing a Ph.D. typically fill the majority of internship openings.</p>
<p>The duration of a typical internship varies from 3 months to 1 year, with the majority of interns being employed during the summer months. As the summer is a very busy time, we encourage applications for non-summer internships and also prefer early applications for summer internships. Hiring decisions for the summer are typically made around February/March to allow enough time for any necessary paperwork (such as visa applications or other work eligibility forms) to be completed.</p><p>MERL is seeking a highly motivated, qualified intern to assist with research projects in the area of decision analytics and optimization. The ideal candidate would have a solid mathematics background, nonlinear optimization techniques, preferably in global optimization of nonlinear programs. The candidate will develop and implement optimization algorithms, assist in the preparation of invention disclosures and papers. The internship is expected to last approximately 3 months.</p>

In a world where you can watch any listen to any song ever recorded in just a couple clicks on a computer that fits in your pocket, people shouldn't be dying because they were given medicine they were allergic to in the emergency room because the ER doctor didnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt have access to the patientÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs medical records.ÃÂÃÂ <br><br>We have done the seemingly impossible, an application that doesnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt change the doctors' workflow yet manages their patient records electronically.

The Social Entrepreneurship Portfolio Director will be responsible for the ongoing development and execution of our regional and global programs and will use his or her leadership and operational expertise gained at a social entrepreneurial organization (domestic or international) or enterprise to influence grantee-centric philanthropy.

<li>Evaluate opportunities that might further the FoundationÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs mission or that of its grantees</li>
<li>Report to and keep the Executive Director apprised of grantee developments and needs</li>
</ul>","<p><b>Qualifications (education/skills, etc.):</b></p>

<li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills; ability to convey complex ideas and questions in a straightforward fashion</li>
<li>Ability to manage the interests of multiple stakeholders simultaneously: grantees, funding partners, the Peery family</li>
<li>Ability to promote, draw from, and positively influence a collaborative environment</li>
<li>Strong organizational and leadership skills with demonstrated ability to execute and work autonomously</li>
<li>Highly creative; able to solve problems in new ways</li>

We are looking for people that are quick learners, and are very efficient, to handle the demand. <br><br>We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! <br><br><br>We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. <br><br><br>Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us. We simply call that exclusive lead and set up an appointment with them. We meet the customer in their home and go over what type of mortgage protection the homeowner needs and then write up the policy. We also market and promote fixed indexed annuities that solve most of the baby boomers retirement issues. <br><br><br>We have many full time agents making over 6 and 7 figure incomes! We are primarily looking for those that desire to move into management, though, if you are looking for part time or full time warm sales, please send your resume as well. We have a serious demand all over the 703/202/301 area that consistently outweighs our number of agents. <br><br><br>Typically our employees make 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management. Though, we design a specific plan to make sure you hit whatever compensation YOU seriously desire, and are willing to work for. <br><br>What we are looking for: <br>* A passion to honestly help families. <br>* Positive attitude with a strong desire to become wealthy. <br>* A person who can follow a step by step selling system. <br><br><br>What we are not looking for: <br>*Someone who isn't accountable to their word. <br>*Someone who says they are a great salesman, but doesn't have a penny to their name. <br>*Someone who has had a recent foreclosure or bankruptcy (you can't get licensed in those cases) <br><br>We need you and you need us.
