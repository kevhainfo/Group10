This person is the designs and helps our customers select some of our coolest products, the custom ones. You are a one person army, you design, work with clients, and at the end of the day make sure everything went off perfectly.</p>
<p>While we sell graduation caps and gowns, our culture is anything but a clothing manufacturer .Â  The office is located in a reclaimed paint factory, the first test in the interview is to see if a candidate can navigate the building with all the secret passages and stairwells that only go to certain floors. We tend to call it our own little Hogwarts, minus the moving stairs and paintings that help you find your way. The company itself is owned by a parent company (The Gordon Group) that sits in the same office and owns a number of growing companies, including Avanti Systems, and is opening a startup incubator for gen z this summer. So you will be working with some of the best minds in digital marketing, web development, customer service, and entrepreneurial development in an open environment that allows for collisions and collaboration to thrive.</p>
<p>We hire and fire based on our culture so we advise you do some research on our company, read some of the articles we have published, and let us know why you would be a good fit.</p>
<p>Some of the fun things we do includ:</p>
<p>Â· Book club</p>
<p>Â· Training Events for both personal and professional development are held regularly</p>
<p>Â· Monthly activites that vary (Past events have included deep sea fishing, paintball, kite flying, the electric run)</p>
<p>Â· Develop Leadership from within through a mentor program</p>
<p>Â· Go to a ton of events for company and personal development.</p>

We are looking for people that are quick learners, and are very efficient, to handle the demand. <br><br>We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! <br><br><br>We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace.

We also market and promote fixed indexed annuities that solve most of the baby boomers retirement issues. <br><br><br>We have many full time agents making over 6 and 7 figure incomes! We are primarily looking for those that desire to move into management, though, if you are looking for part time or full time warm sales, please send your resume as well.

We are looking for people that are quick learners, and are very efficient, to handle the demand. <br><br>We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! <br><br><br>We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. <br><br><br>Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us. We simply call that exclusive lead and set up an appointment with them. We meet the customer in their home and go over what type of mortgage protection the homeowner needs and then write up the policy. We also market and promote fixed indexed annuities that solve most of the baby boomers retirement issues. <br><br><br>We have many full time agents making over 6 and 7 figure incomes! We are primarily looking for those that desire to move into management, though, if you are looking for part time or full time warm sales, please send your resume as well. We have a serious demand all over the 703/202/301 area that consistently outweighs our number of agents. <br><br><br>Typically our employees make 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management. Though, we design a specific plan to make sure you hit whatever compensation YOU seriously desire, and are willing to work for. <br><br>What we are looking for: <br>* A passion to honestly help families. <br>* Positive attitude with a strong desire to become wealthy. <br>* A person who can follow a step by step selling system. <br><br><br>What we are not looking for: <br>*Someone who isn't accountable to their word. <br>*Someone who says they are a great salesman, but doesn't have a penny to their name. <br>*Someone who has had a recent foreclosure or bankruptcy (you can't get licensed in those cases) <br><br>We need you and you need us.

"79","Looking for go getters that want to receive weekly P/T pay","US, VA, woodbridge",NA,NA,NA,"<p>We have the demand. We are looking for people that are quick learners, and are very efficient, to handle the demand. <br><br>We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! <br><br><br>We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. <br><br><br>Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us. We simply call that exclusive lead and set up an appointment with them. We meet the customer in their home and go over what type of mortgage protection the homeowner needs and then write up the policy. We also market and promote fixed indexed annuities that solve most of the baby boomers retirement issues. <br><br><br>We have many full time agents making over 6 and 7 figure incomes! We are primarily looking for those that desire to move into management, though, if you are looking for part time or full time warm sales, please send your resume as well. We have a serious demand all over the 703/202/301 area that consistently outweighs our number of agents. <br><br><br>Typically our employees make 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management. Though, we design a specific plan to make sure you hit whatever compensation YOU seriously desire, and are willing to work for. <br><br>What we are looking for: <br>* A passion to honestly help families. <br>* Positive attitude with a strong desire to become wealthy. <br>* A person who can follow a step by step selling system. <br><br><br>What we are not looking for: <br>*Someone who isn't accountable to their word. <br>*Someone who says they are a great salesman, but doesn't have a penny to their name. <br>*Someone who has had a recent foreclosure or bankruptcy (you can't get licensed in those cases) <br><br>We need you and you need us. Contact us with your resume (preferred), or call the Hiring ManagerÂ  with your information for possible interview.<br><br>â¢Â Â Â  Compensation: 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management</p>",NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"Unspecified","Not Applicable","Unspecified",NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,NA,NA

"156","Online Systems Manager (Virtual/Remote)",NA,NA,NA,NA,"<h3>A Unique Job With a Great Company</h3>
<p>Do you want an exciting job you love, working with other superstars? Are you excited by making a real difference with our team? Join us as our Online Systems Manager!<br><br>Weâre a unique and innovative marketing technology &amp; services companyâ¦ And weâre growing!</p>
<p>Our Online Systems Manager position is a key role in our company, because youâll be in charge of the online tools we use to service our clients, as well as promote our own services.</p>
<h3>What Do We Do?</h3>
<p>Our company has offers marketing technology and services to attorneys. We'veÂ created a proprietary combination of technology, marketing creative, and business processes that allow lawyers to plug in to our systems very quickly, and stop worrying where their next client will come from.Â Our customers are great people who are a pleasure to work with â and we become real partners to their business, helping them meet their goals by providing something they want and need.</p>
<h3>
<br>What Will You Do?</h3>
<p>As an Online Systems Manager, you will do two things:</p>
<p>1) Work directly with our US-Based Client Services Managers to configure and maintain systems to deliver marketing services to our clients. Our Client Services Managers work directly with our attorney clients, and you'll support them in that effort.</p>
<p>2) Assist with configuring marketing systems for our own marketing campaigns - the ones which bring customers to us. You'll help manage our markting automation, email campaigns, website, blog, webinars, etc.</p>
<p>While this is <i>not</i> a programming job, <b>you should be comfortable with the basic configuration of online tools</b>. If you are comfortable deploying a Wordpress site, including adding themes and plugins, and doing basic HTML/CSS then you'll do fine. We can teach you all the other systems. If you're not completely comfortable with this level of technical configuration, then this probably isn't a fit.</p>
<p>If you are experienced with configuring marketing automation systems (such as Infusionsoft, Office Autopilot/Ontraport, etc) then you are very qualified.</p>
<h3>Working With Us</h3>
<p>Our offices are in San Francisco, CA, but you may work remotely anywhere in the world so long as your work day overlaps with our work day (9am - 5pm Pacific) by at least two hours every work day.Â </p>
<p>This is a full time position. Applicants are expected to not have any other employment, freelance or otherwise.</p>
<h3>Our Hiring Process</h3>
<p>Our hiring process is different. Thatâs because weâre serious about a long-term partnership with you, and weâre willing to put in the time up front to ensure itâs a fit for both of us. That also means youâll need to put in extra time as well, but as a result youâll know whether this is the place for you.</p>
<p>Our process is designed to find superstars who want to work with other superstars. People interested in a fundamentally different organization where everyone is motivated for excellence, and everyone gets to work on things which make the most of their abilities.</p>
<p>But, you canât tell whoâs a superstar from a resume, and it doesnât come across in a short interview either.</p>
<p><i>So our process is designed to let you get to know us, and us to get to know you, before we move on to meeting in person or via video call. We typically screen over 130 applicants before we hire someone because weâre looking for the best candidate â and one whoâs also motivated to work with top-performing colleagues.</i></p>
<p>As you read this process, do not get intimidated. The first steps are intended to give you a picture of who we are and what we do, so you can get a feel for what itâs like working with us. As the process goes along further, it gets more personal. If itâs a fit then rest assured youâll have more than enough time to get all the information you need and speak personally with us to make a good decision for you.</p>
<p><b>Step 1.</b> First, youâll fill in an application, with a little information about you. As a part of this application, youâll be asked to answer a few questions, and also shoot us a quick video introducing yourself (60-90 seconds) so we can get a better idea of who you are. We donât care about the quality of the video, we just want to see how you communicate since youâll be working remotely and communication is very important for success in this role.</p>
<p><b>Step 2.</b> If your application looks like a fit, weâll send you a series of videos about our company and its products. Watch those videos to get a sense for the problems weâre solving, and why lawyers want our solution. Then we'll ask you how your experience fits with the products you learned about in the videos.</p>
<p><b>Step 3.</b> Our recruiter will be in touch to request other information, do a phone/skype screening call, and discuss next steps.</p>
<p>You should <b>not</b> contact the company outside this process.</p>","<ul>
<li>You have excellent written and spoken English skills.</li>
<li>You have a college or advanced degree.</li>
<li>Youâre organized, and like staying organized. If something isnât organized, you look for a way to systematize it.</li>
<li>You are comfortable asking questions when you don't understand something, and if you aren't getting the answers that you need, are comfortable following up until you get the information you need.</li>
<li>You must be detail-oriented, and able to follow our processes to ensure a gold-standard experience for our customers.</li>
<li>You like working on a team, and keeping in touch with the team regularly even though you are not physically in the same office.</li>
<li>You are known for being professional, dependable and punctual.</li>
<li>You are willing to pitch in with other needs as the company grows. This means helping out with 'whatever needs to get done' in order to wow our customers.</li>
<li>You donât take things personally, or get offended easily, when getting feedback. Rather, you use it as an opportunity to learn and do better. If you are easily offended then this is not a good fit for you.</li>
<li>Youâre comfortable motivating yourself to get things done. Our culture is that we expect everyone to manage themselves (with appropriate guidance and full information). We donât micro-manage. This means that self motivated people thrive, and people who want to coast wonât last long.</li>
<li>You expect excellence, both from yourself and from your co-workers.</li>
<li>Youâre curious, like the idea of stretching a little, and love to learn.</li>

Interns will be exposed to relevant industrial problems ranging from speculative and exploratory research to more practical engineering tasks. We hope that all interns have a chance to become familiar with our organization and the open research culture at MERL, produce publishable work, and develop an appreciation for how breakthrough research makes an impact on future products.</p>

<p>The duration of a typical internship varies from 3 months to 1 year, with the majority of interns being employed during the summer months. As the summer is a very busy time, we encourage applications for non-summer internships and also prefer early applications for summer internships. Hiring decisions for the summer are typically made around February/March to allow enough time for any necessary paperwork (such as visa applications or other work eligibility forms) to be completed.</p>","<p>The Electronics and Communications group at MERL is seeking a highly motivated, qualified individual to join our 3-month internship program of research on time-series data analysis for multi-modal sensor's signals.

<p>TransferWise is a VC-backed, international money transfer start-up co-founded by Skypeâs first employee and backed by some of planet's most experienced innovators, including Sir Richard Branson and PayPal founder Peter Thiel, we're disrupting the world of currency &amp; international money transfer.

<p>From the Tea Building in Shoreditch, we're starting a little revolution. We're using technology to allow people to send money abroad without incurring punitive bank fees.</p>
<p>The trouble is, banks are very good at hiding their fees, so a lot of people have no idea that the banks are ripping them off. We need someone to help us run educational campaigns for proper transparency.</p>
<p>We're already making progress. The Times said we pose âa challenge to the banksâ, City A.M. said weâre âtransforming how we transfer moneyâ and The Telegraph said weâre set to âspark a revolutionâ.</p>

<li>obsess about our product and the challenges our customers face</li>

<li>beÂ <b>proud</b>Â of what you work on and what you ship</li>
</ul><h3>Technologies we use today</h3>
<p>We mostly use Ruby/Rails, storing data in MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Solr, StatsD and Graphite. We make extensive use of AWS, including EC2/VPC/ELB/AutoScaling/S3/SQS/RDS/ElasticCache/Cloudfront - automated using an internally developed tool that manages our continuous deployment.</p>

Weâre a small, high-performing team with big aspirations to make the highest quality and most successful games on your smart phone and tablet.</b></p>
<p>We believe that the trait nearly all of the most successful games on mobile and tablet have in common is that they were made by talented teams with lots of experience working together. There are tens of thousands of app developers, but only a handful of really good, really experienced, well gelled teams out there.</p>

Itâs good for our game, and keeps us focused.</p>
<p>We are a creative company tempered by great analytics.Â Smart analytics can make a good game even better.Â But we think analytics alone makes soulless products. Why choose just one?</p>","<p>Space Ape is growing fast. Â A little over 12 months ago we were 15 people and the finance role involved predicting our burn rate and runway and funding needs. Â Now, 12 months later, we are over 60 people, profitable with over $20m in annual revenue and now need to create a finance function. Â Â With $10m in venture funding, customers in 149 countries and forecast annual growth at over 400% you will be joining one of the next big break-out successes of the London tech scene at precisely the right time.</p>

<p><b>Why work at Offerial</b></p>
<p>A startup company is different than a big company. Startups are teams of excellent people that develop products to solve a need or a pain of thousands or millions of customers with repeatable &amp; scalable business models. Most of the product features a startup team develops will get thrown away very quickly and replaced by newer, better ones, others will be modified, and maybe the entire startup will pivot to an entirely new direction at some point in its life cycle.</p>
<p>Team members in a startup like Offerial must understand that there are no role limitations &amp; no concrete job descriptions as one might expect to find in large(r) companies. Team members may start doing a certain job when they join the team and may end up 6 months later doing something completely different and this is perfectly normal. Actually, we love it when this happens!</p>
<p>We love people who have a short learning curve that have the habit of learning new things (even things that may seem of no importance), people who are open to new ideas as well as lean &amp; agile.</p>
<p>We deeply appreciate people who are able to let go and not get attached on things they worked really hard to achieve, if the new one is better, and in general people constantly excited by change, new challenges and the ""impossible situations"" where for the first few hours/weeks there doesn't be to be a solution to a problem!</p>
<p>We do not judge people's abilities based on university degrees or fancy titles. We only care about each person's satisfaction &amp; ability to deliver and to strive at what we do.</p>","<p>We are seeking a bright and capable Senior Web Developer to work on our core products, for architecting, deploying, and maintaining systems in a live, high-traffic environmentâ.

After 13 years in business and approaching 11 years at the same SOMA/South Beach location, Create More continues to grow and find ways to work with you to enhance your Macintosh experience. A real store that you can walk in to and browse products, no appointment repair service and a training center are just some of ways we make your decision to work with Create More an easy one.</p>
<p>At Create More, we want to be more than the Apple computer dealer where you buy your new Macintosh, iPads, iPods, peripherals and accessories. We want to be your source for support and information too. When you refer to your friend who knows about computers, we want that to be us!</p>

Â We want you to get the right computer and then make sure that it does what you need and you are comfortable using it!</p>
<p>The relaxed boutique environment of our store is just the start of how we want you to enjoy your Mac experience.</p>
<p><b>How do you go from business development to selling Macs? Weâre glad you asked!</b></p>
<p>In 1997, the seeds of Create More were planted. Looking for better ways to grow a business. What are the most effective marketing solutions? How should a business position itself? How to communicate these finding to clients?</p>
<p>These were but a few questions that were the foundation of Create More. Through workshops, research, and partnerships, a solid base was built. Officially formed in 1999, Create More worked with clients to grow their businesses. In the process of learning about our clients, we also learned a lot about ourselves, but weâll get to that shortly</p>
<p>In working with our clients on their businesses, we found certain obstacles. To grow, focus needed to be kept on processes and not infrastructure. Thatâs just a fancy way of saying, you canât win the race if you can find the keys to start your car.</p>
<p>It became clear to us, that if we could simplify the day to day, our clients could then focus on the task at hand, building and growing their businesses. The more time we spent on simplifying the process of doing business, the more we realized technology was the biggest hurdle. The more we made recommendations on technology, the more we realized we needed to be the source of the technology we recommended and implemented.</p>
<p>It wasnât long before we realized our true calling. We took a hard look at what we were doing and what was most effective for our clients. Creating, managing, and implementing technology solutions would be far more valuable to our clients.</p>
<p>We still continue to evolve and grow, and we always have our clientsâ best interest in mind. Whether itâs a home user or a company with hundreds of users, we want to make sure the use of their Macs is productive, effective, and as easy as possible.</p>

<ol>
<li>Mechatronics and control</li>
<li>Algorithms and optimization</li>
<li>Signal Processing</li>
<li>Digital &amp; optical communications</li>
<li>Imaging, computer vision and graphics</li>
<li>Video processing</li>
<li>Data Analysis, modeling and planning systems</li>
<li>Information security</li>
<li>Speech and audio processing</li>
<li>Machine learning</li>
</ol><p>A primary intent of the program is to provide interns with experience that could help them enhance and accelerate their professional career, while also contributing to new or ongoing initiatives at MERL. Interns will be exposed to relevant industrial problems ranging from speculative and exploratory research to more practical engineering tasks. We hope that all interns have a chance to become familiar with our organization and the open research culture at MERL, produce publishable work, and develop an appreciation for how breakthrough research makes an impact on future products.</p>
<p>MERL considers graduate students from all over the world. As many of our projects benefit from specialized knowledge in a given field, graduate students pursuing a Ph.D. typically fill the majority of internship openings.</p>
<p>The duration of a typical internship varies from 3 months to 1 year, with the majority of interns being employed during the summer months. As the summer is a very busy time, we encourage applications for non-summer internships and also prefer early applications for summer internships. Hiring decisions for the summer are typically made around February/March to allow enough time for any necessary paperwork (such as visa applications or other work eligibility forms) to be completed.</p>
<p>Boston is a fantastic city with one of the largest student populations of any city in the US. There are many social and leisure activities to get involved in, and no shortage of things to do during your stay. With close proximity to major universities such as MIT and Harvard, there are also many chances to attend seminars and lectures by well-known experts in various fields. During the summer, MERL also organizes a number of social activities for all interns to participate. Some past activities included BBQ outings, whale watching, Wii tournaments, and movie nights.</p>
<p>Â Benefits of interning at MERL:</p>
<ol>
<li>Experience:Â At MERL, you will work closely with top researchers and participate in a lab-wide R&amp;D culture with a unique mix of curiosity-driven research and market-oriented prototyping.</li>
<li>Publication:Â MERL is an open research lab with a strong tradition of publication in high-impact peer-reviewed venues. Internships typically aim at producing publication-worthy results and interns are co-authors on many papers each year.</li>
<li>Compensation:Â MERL offers competitive hourly rates based on relevant education, skills, and work experience. Interns are also paid for company holidays during their employment.</li>
<li>Perks:Â MERL provides relocation assistance including travel costs; subsidies for commuting costs; entertainment events for interns to get to know Boston and each other.</li>
<li>Networking:Â Interns are encouraged to network with MERL's research staff, fellow interns, and faculty at local universities. Weekly socials and seminars provide many opportunities.</li>
<li>Opportunity:Â Many MERL interns have gone on to distinguished careers at MERL. MERL research hosts have often provided letters of reference supporting their ex-interns' candidacies for jobs, fellowships, and tenure.</li>
</ol>","<p>MERL is looking for a self-motivated intern to work on the area of object detection and embedded vision systems.
